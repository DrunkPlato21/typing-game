The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
To be or not to be, that is the question
Better late than never
Honesty is the best policy
Practice makes perfect
Time is money
No pain, no gain
Actions speak louder than words
A penny saved is a penny earned
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
To be or not to be, that is the question
All that glitters is not gold
A picture is worth a thousand words
Actions speak louder than words
The early bird catches the worm
Better late than never
Honesty is the best policy
A penny saved is a penny earned
Birds of a feather flock together
A watched pot never boils
Beggars can't be choosers
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Every cloud has a silver lining
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on me
Good things come to those who wait
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If you can't beat them, join them
It's no use crying over spilled milk
Laughter is the best medicine
Let sleeping dogs lie
Look before you leap
No pain, no gain
Practice makes perfect
Rome wasn't built in a day
The pen is mightier than the sword
There's no place like home
Time is money
Two heads are better than one
You can't judge a book by its cover
A rolling stone gathers no moss
A stitch in time saves nine
All's fair in love and war
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Bite the bullet
Break the ice
Burn the midnight oil
Cat got your tongue
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut to the chase
Devil's advocate
Don't beat around the bush
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't burn your bridges
Don't cry wolf
Every dog has its day
Familiarity breeds contempt
Get out of hand
Give the benefit of the doubt
Go down in flames
Hear it on the grapevine
Hit the nail on the head
Ignorance is bliss
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Kill two birds with one stone
Last but not least
Let the cat out of the bag
Live and learn
Look before you leap
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
No stone unturned
Not a spark of decency
Not playing with a full deck
Off the hook
On the ball
Once in a blue moon
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Piece of cake
Pulling your leg
Put a sock in it
See eye to eye
Sit on the fence
Speak of the devil
Steal someone's thunder
Take it with a grain of salt
The best of both worlds
The devil is in the details
The elephant in the room
Throw caution to the wind
Under the weather
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wrap your head around it
You can't have your cake and eat it too
A diamond in the rough
A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Add insult to injury
All in the same boat
Back to the drawing board
Barking up the wrong tree
Beating a dead horse
Bite off more than you can chew
Burn the candle at both ends
By the skin of your teeth
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Costs an arm and a leg
Cross that bridge when you come to it
